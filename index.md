---

Software systems need to evolve to fulfill changing requirements and the cost of this takes up a major part of software development effort. *Software architecture evolution*, i.e., the evolution of the fundamental organization of a software system, is particularly complex and costly in that (i) the software architecture needs to be correctly understood and (ii) changes made to the software architecture lead to massive changes in the implementation. 

The Akhera project goes beyond the state-of-the-art of software architecture evolution by providing new understanding, techniques, and a reference implementation that address challenges (i) through *architecture re-construction* and (ii) through *architectural slicing*.
